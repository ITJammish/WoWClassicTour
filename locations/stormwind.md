**Stormwind**
Stormwind City is located north of Elwynn Forest on the Eastern Kingdom's northwest coast, and is the capital city of the kingdom known as Stormwind and the largest human city of Azeroth. However the city-state also controls or influences other territories, which include Elwynn Forest, Northshire Valley, the Redridge Mountains, Westfall, and Duskwood. The city is named for the occasional sudden squalls created by a ley line pattern in the mountains around the glorious city, and is one of the last great human cities. The city itself has been rebuilt at least once, and is a marvel of human design and engineering.

Stormwind firmly backs the Alliance, and its knights, priests, paladins, and mages served in the three wars against the Horde. Primarily a human settlement, a fair number of high elves, Ironforge dwarves, and even a few night elves and gnomes dwell here as well. Stormwind City is the home of the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only remaining school of wizardry in the east, and the Cathedral of Light, the philosophical capital for those who follow the Holy Light. These edifices draw healers, priests, paladins, and mages to the city, all of whom bolster Stormwindâ€™s military.

DRINK: Old town at Pig and Whistle Tavern.
