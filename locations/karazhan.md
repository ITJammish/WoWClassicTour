**Karazhan**
> Karazhan's history begins with an explosion that carved out Deadwind Pass and weakened the fabric of reality in the region, creating potent Ley Lines. Some time later, the guardian of Tirisfal Aegwynn realized this and forged the tower of Karazhan herself. The tower functioned as both a place of solitude, and a conduit she could use to siphon power from the ley lines.

> During the First War, the tower was inhabited by Medivh, his steward Moroes, his cook named Cook, and his then-apprentice Khadgar. After Medivh was killed by Khadgar, Lothar, and Garona, the tower sealed itself off from the rest of the world. But recently, Karazhan has reawakened â€” an evil presence has taken the tower as its own, its halls crawling with spirits and demons... and Medivh's presence is still alive and well, even decades after his death.
