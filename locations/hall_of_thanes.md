**Old Ironforge/Hall of Thanes**
> The Hall of Thanes is a massive, natural cavern complex located in Ironforge’s lowest depths. The area is a true marvel of organic stone formation: no dwarf has touched this area with pick or chisel. Ironforge’s kings are buried in the Hall of Thanes, and the old throne is there as well. Also within this cavernous area is the ancient, weathered Iron Forge — perhaps the greatest titan artifact ever unearthed.
