**Scarlet Monastery**
> The Monastery was once a proud bastion of Lordaeron's priesthood - a center for learning and enlightenment. With the rise of the undead Scourge during the Third War, the peaceful Monastery was converted into a stronghold of the fanatical Scarlet Crusade. The Crusaders are intolerant of all non-human races, regardless of alliance or affiliation. They believe that any and all outsiders are potential carriers of the undead plague - and must be destroyed.

> A scripted event can be triggered upon entering the Cathedral wing of the Scarlet Monastery with Corrupted Ashbringer equipped, a sword found in Naxxramas wielded by Alexandros Mograine; the father of the final boss in Scarlet Monastery.
