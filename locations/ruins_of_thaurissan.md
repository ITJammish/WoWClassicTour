**Ruins of Thaurissan**
> Hundreds of years ago, the city, named after Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan, stood proudly in a lush expanse of land that is now the dilapidated Burning Steppes. Thaurissan was home to the nation of Dark Iron dwarves and at the time, in the midst of a civil war among the dwarven nation at large.

> The area surrounding the ruins was at one point in time part of the Redridge Mountains â€” until the day that Thaurissan was consumed by a gigantic explosion, as Thaurissan attempted to summon the ancient Firelord Ragnaros. The city lay in ruin, the surrounding areas reduced to an ashy wasteland. The Dark Irons that survived made their way into the mountain and began rebuilding their city.

> From the ashes of Thaurissan then rose Blackrock Spire and the new Dark iron nation. Additional fortifications were made within the Searing Gorge, in the area known as the Cauldron.

> An expedition was commissioned, to find mysterious relics rumored to still lie within the ruins of the city. While none of the relics were able to be brought back in one piece, the information revealed was still priceless. Apparently, merely touching the relics caused memories of the destruction of Thaurissan to overwhelm the explorers, flooding his sight with visions of the terrible ruin wrought upon the city.
