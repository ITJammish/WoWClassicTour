**Andorhal**
> Andorhal was once the distribution center for all agricultural supplies in the northern provinces of Lordaeron east of Lordamere Lake before the Third War. It was used by Kel'Thuzad to spread the plague, infecting the grain here, which was sent to different northern towns. Andorhal was gripped by the original outbreak of the Plague of Undeath, but remained uncontrolled by Scourge agents. Kel'Thuzad was initially defeated by Arthas in Andorhal. However, Andorhal fell at the hands of Arthas when he returned here to claim the remains of Kel'Thuzad for reanimation, therefore falling under Scourge control.

> Following the defeat of the Burning Legion and the consolidation of the Western Plaguelands by the Scourge, Andorhal became a regional bastion effectively separating the lands of the Lich King from those still under mortal control.

> Now, Andorhal has become the headquarters of the lich Araj the Summoner who uses the ruined city as the base of operations, from which he oversees the use of the mighty plague cauldrons situated throughout the Western Plaguelands.

> The roads leading north out of Andorhal are occasionally patrolled by forces of the Scarlet Crusade â€” either survivors of Andorhal or troops sent from nearby Hearthglen.
