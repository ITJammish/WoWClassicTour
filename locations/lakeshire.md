**Lakeshire**
> Lakeshire, aka Township of Lakeshire, is an ancient human town that sits on the banks of the majestic and large Lake Everstill (from which the town gets its name). It's located in Redridge Mountains, and has 1,500 citizens — mostly farmers, poachers, and travellers — that reside there under the watchful (and often worried) eye of elected Magistrate Solomon. The town is considered a serene and quiet place. Even with the occasional incursions by the orcs, it is a prime example of how peaceful this area was before the coming of the Horde and the Great Wars.
