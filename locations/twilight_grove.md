**Twilight Grove**
The Twilight Grove is host to a Great Tree: saplings of the World Tree and portals to the Emerald Dream. Great Trees can be found in Feralas, Ashenvale, The Hinterlands, Duskwood, and Crystalsong Forest on the continent of Northrend.

In recent times, Ysera's most trusted lieutenants (Lethon, Ysondre, Emeriss, and Taerar) have been warped by a dark new power within the Emerald Dream and are now known as The Dragons of Nightmare. Now these wayward sentinels have passed through the Great Trees into Azeroth, intending to spread madness and terror throughout the mortal kingdoms. Even the mightiest of adventurers would be well advised to give the dragons a wide berth, or suffer the consequences of their misguided wrath.
