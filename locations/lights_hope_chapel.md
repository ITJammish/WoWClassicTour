**Light's hope chapel**
Light's Hope Chapel is the Argent Dawn's base of operations in the Eastern Plaguelands, currently used for diplomatic negotiations between the Argent Dawn and Scarlet Crusade.

Underneath the chapel is a catacomb which houses the remains of the heroes of Lordaeron. Many of the remains were exhumed and moved to the chapelâ€™s holy ground so they could not be resurrected in the service of the Lich King.
