**Goldshire**
> Heavily protected and patrolled by the Stormwind guards, Goldshire canonically sports a population of 7,000 citizens â€” mostly farmers, miners, and traders. The leader is an elected Marshal, and the position is currently occupied by Marshal Dughan. Many refugees from Westfall move to Goldshire and Elwynn Forest in an attempt to escape the Defias Brotherhood. It is considered a village by Stormwind standards.

> Just south of Goldshire is located the Fargodeep Mine, The Maclure Vineyards, and The Stonefield Farm. To the east is Crystal Lake, a place where there are several Murlocs. To the southeast is Jerod's Landing, a place where many thugs and bandits hide.

> In the northeastern part of Goldshire there is a house with skinning and leatherworking trainers. On the second floor of this house there is a room where spooky music plays, and in this room the children can sometimes be seen forming the pattern of a pentagram, silent and unmoving. Known as The Children of Goldshire, they will occasionally move out of the house to walk/run in a pentagram formation. They return to their house at around 7:40 in the morning, and at this time a sound file will play. Rumors state sometimes Cameron will say, "Remember C'Thun? Good ol' C'Thun."

> The children often face different directions. One day they'll face Stormwind City, and other days a mine. It seems they point in five different locations within Elwynn Forest that make a pentagram.
