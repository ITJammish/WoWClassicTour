**Gnomeregan**
Gnomeregan was the capital city/kingdom of the gnome race until a trogg invasion led to its tragic downfall. In a desperate attempt to kill the troggs, their ruler, on the advice of advisor Mekgineer Thermaplugg, detonated a radiation bomb in its halls, but only succeeded in corrupting whatever gnomes that remained - and empowering the victorious troggs.

The troggs had risen from the bowels of the earth and invaded Gnomeregan during the Third War. Knowing their allies' priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the gnomes decided to make their stand alone against the troggs.

Though they fought valiantly to save their beloved city, Gnomeregan was lost and nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race was wiped out during its fall. The ragged survivors fled to the safety of Ironforge.

A few loyal gnomes still left in the city fought desperately to keep the troggs at bay. Their ruler, thought by certain gnomes to have abandoned them, eventually sent a rescue force of adventurers on a recon mission. They slew many troggs and ended up killing Mekgineer Thermaplugg and his rebellious gnomes.
