**Pyrewood Village**
> Pyrewood Village is a settlement inhabited by a group of humans who have survived the coming of the Scourge, though not without paying a large price. The village survived the Plague due to the efforts of the blood elves and later due to the military aid of Dalaran.

> Pyrewood's inhabitants have been cursed so that they undergo a nightly transformation into the bestial worgen (measured at 8:59PMâ€“9:00PM server time), then return to their human forms upon the arrival of dawn. It is during this time that they become hostile. Despite all its hardships, however, the village continues to service Alliance travellers by selling cloth, leather, and mail armor to customers.
