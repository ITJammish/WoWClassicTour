**Deeprun Tram**
> The Deeprun Tram is a long, fully enclosed, underground (and partially underwater) set of double tracks upon two sets of which rolls three wagons, all credited to the gnomes' technical engineering. The service is fast and smooth, and is provided free of charge to travelers between the Alliance-aligned cities of Ironforge and Stormwind City.

> The tram was built in the aftermath of the Second War. King Magni Bronzebeard was frustrated at the sluggish pace with which his country's aid was being delivered to Stormwind, and eager as well to establish a means of reinforcing the human kingdom with dwarven soldiers should the need arise. To address these two concerns, King Bronzebeard turned to Azeroth's most esteemed engineer, High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, who immediately began drafting designs for a grand subterranean railway system that would link Stormwind and Ironforge.

> The tram takes 60 seconds to travel from one end of the system to the other, and waits for 12 seconds at either station.
