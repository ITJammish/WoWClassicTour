**Uther's Tomb**
Uther the Lightbringer and some of the remaining paladins of The Silver Hand had taken control of Andorhal after the fall of Lordaeron until Arthas (who had become the greatest of the Lich King's death knights) came to find a magical vessel to carry the remains of Kel'Thuzad to the Sunwell in Quel'Thalas in order to resurrect him. Arthas led an army of undead minions to kill those defending the city and confront Uther. They engaged in combat, Uther had nearly defeated Arthas at one stage, but with the might of Frostmourne, Arthas killed Uther and took the urn of King Terenas for himself.

Uther's body was retrieved by his remaining soldiers, and buried here in the great tomb, vigilantly guarded by defenders of the Alliance.
