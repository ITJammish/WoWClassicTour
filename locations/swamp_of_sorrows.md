**Swamp of Sorrows**
> Originally, the Swamp of Sorrows was the northern part of an enormous swampland called the Black Morass, the southern half now known as the Blasted Lands. After the fall of the Gurubashi Empire, a renegade faction of trolls, the Atal'ai, fled into the swamp and built a large temple, the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. Ysera of the green dragonflight learned of their evil plans, drowned the temple into the largest bog, and sent several members of her flight to guard the ruins.
