**Stonewrought Dam**
*Optional item: Noggenfogger Elixir (or alternative slowfall)*

> The massive Stonewrought Dam was built by the dwarves of Ironforge and is one of the most impressive wonders of the world. The construction dams up Loch Modan, more than doubling its original size. The dam also creates the flooded plains of the Wetlands, which previously were mostly underwater.

> The Dam was architected by Franclorn Forgewright, creator of the twin hammers Ironfel and Ironfoe. His ghost can be found in the central rock within Blackrock mountain.
