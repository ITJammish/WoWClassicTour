**Statue of Lothar**
> Sir Anduin Lothar, the Lion of Azeroth, was the last true descendant of the ancient Arathi bloodline, a knight champion of the Kingdom of Azeroth (later known as the Kingdom of Stormwind) during the First War, and the supreme commander of the armies of the Alliance of Lordaeron during the Second War. He perished in combat (here) at the base of Blackrock Mountain just before the end of the Second War and the closing of the Dark Portal. He is considered one of the greatest warriors of all time.
