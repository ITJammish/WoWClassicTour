**Azeroth Tour: Eastern Kingdoms**
So, your guild has started to raid log between content releases and you're looking for something to do together. Why not take some down time, throw on some RP gear and see the sights around Eastern Kingdoms?

Welcome to Sagrell's Eastern Kingdoms tour for World of Warcraft Classic!

**Upfront:**
The tour was designed for an Alliance group. While the tour does go to Undercity, it only goes to the outside areas and won't likely incur PvP unless you hang around for longer than a few minutes. The tour does go through both Ironforge and Stormwind.

The information comes predominantly from https://wowwiki.fandom.com/ with some edits. I did not write the majority of the information myself and cannot garentee the complete accuracy of the information contained within.

The tour runs for approximately 3 hours and includes some optional activites, but feel free to cut/change/add your own locations, games, routes and rules (drinking or otherwise).

You are very welcome to submit your additions via pull request to this guide for others to use.

**How to get started:**
It's recommended that the tour guide reads through the guide before hand to get a feel for the route and writing style. If you wish to make changes to the content or add your own notes it's recommened that you download/fork your own copy of the guide.

How to use the guide:

How to run the tour:
- suggest turning on and up game music
- introduce any rules and set expectations
- it's recommended to include a Mage for portals when convienient, and a Warlock to summon late joiners or those who need to catch up.


Adding a map could be useful, but would be a fair bit of work to maintain if new locations are added/removed, or if the route is altered.
