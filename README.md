**Azeroth Tour: Eastern Kingdoms**
So, your guild has started to raid log between content releases and you're looking for something to do together. Why not take some down time, throw on some RP gear and see the sights around Eastern Kingdoms?

Welcome to Sagrell's Eastern Kingdoms tour for World of Warcraft Classic!

**Upfront:**
The tour was designed for an Alliance group. While the tour does go to Undercity, it only goes to the outside areas and won't likely incur PvP unless you hang around for longer than a few minutes. The tour does go through both Ironforge and Stormwind.

The information comes predominantly from https://wowwiki.fandom.com/ with some edits. I did not write the majority of the information myself and cannot garentee the complete accuracy of the information contained within. I considered adding a map, but might be a fair bit of work to maintain if new locations are added/removed, or if the route is altered.

The tour runs for approximately 3 hours and includes some optional activites, but feel free to cut/change/add your own locations, games, routes and rules (drinking or otherwise).

You are very welcome to submit your additions via pull request to this guide for others to use.

**How to get started:**
It's recommended that the tour guide reads through the guide before hand to get a feel for the route and writing style.

*Run from github:*
Simply open index.md within this project and you're good to go!

*Run locally/make changes:*
If you wish to make changes to the content or add your own notes it's recommened that you download/fork your own copy of the guide. The guide itself is written using MarkDown, a cheat sheet for which can be found here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet. MarkDown projects can be run directly in your browser, but may need an extension to parse .md files (free extensions are available for Chrome). Once set up and have made your desired changes, open your local copy of index.md in your browser and away you go.

**How to use the guide:**
As recommened above; read through the material briefly to start to give yourself an idea of pacing, and the route your group will take. The guide itself is very simple with an ordered list of locations to visit and a text script for each location.

Consider any optional activities and prepare your group before hand making sure you have the required items. Also note some areas in this tour are high level, so ensure some of your members do bring their gear in case of combat.

**Tips for running the tour:**
- Suggest turning on/up the in-game music to enhance each area as you pass through.
- Introduce any rules and set tour length expectations before-hand/early in the tour.
- Include a Mage in the group for portals when convienient, and a Warlock to summon late joiners or those who need to catch up.
- Schedule regular breaks for your group throughout the tour. In-game inns work well for this.
- Encourage other members to pitch in with extra lore or their own experiences/memories to enhance the event beyond the guide's contents.
- Keep the group moving: the tour is long with a fair bit of travel so keeping the pace can be key to keeping the group's attension. Some locations don't require a stop and look visit and can be passed by whilst reading the script to keep up the pace. E.g. "To your left you'll see the city of Stromgarde..." etc.
